# Andrea's Touch Website Prototype 

Client wanted a simple but sophisticated website that highlighted their monogramming work and their new products

## Design Process

* WireFrame
* Custom Code CSS HTML 
* Incorporate JS libraries
* Add in Shopify to potentially handle the back end

## Challenges 

* Client not yet ready to publish project and the vision of simple e-commerce website balloned as work was completed
* Moving from the safety and familiarity of Bootstrap to full custom CSS and JS
* Making the website responsive through the use of Media Queries instead of relying on BS

## Road for Improvement
* Move to mobile first development
* Improve use of color and visual hierarchy in designs

## Overview

Really enjoyed working on this project and learned a lot of CSS, JS, and responsive development  through study and trial and error during this development process. 


Would hope to fine tune the layout and animations in the future should the client wish to move forward to publication
